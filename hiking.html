    <p class="paragraph-size">Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes. A glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier during summertime, only adding to the location's charm. This popular day tour is the perfect way to know the actual reason behind the name Ice-land!</p>
